<p>My name is Olena Bovdyr; I'm from Ukraine. I'm 44 years old. I live in Edinburgh at the moment. 
My profession is health and safety officer. I like nature, animals, travelling, history, and music. 
Also, I really like painting, and in the gallery, you can see my picture. 
My hobbies are volunteering, going to the gym, and caring for plants.
